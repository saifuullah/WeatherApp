# WeatherApp

This is my WeatherApp front-end (Static GUI interfacse).


# Layout used:
    I have used constraint layout for this.
    


# Description:
      In constraint layout, i have grouped several parts together so that i want to change the position, i can drag it entirly (not one by one).
      All the data (names, city names, temperature details etc) is stored in the strings.xml file as a varibles.
